        <h1>Collecting more documents in Ajami and making them more accessible</h1>
        <p>The idea of this project is to search, collect, digitize and make accessible documents written in Ajami, that is African languages using Arabic script before colonisation imposed the Latin alphabet. While their conservation is astonishing in arid regions, documents may be endangered in others. The project should foster collaboration between scholars and young researchers based in Africa and ease their access to existing archives and documents, in other words, to knowledge. Most Ajami documents available are manuscripts from Timbuktu yet Ajami has been widely used throughout arabophone Africa and one might find more in other places. The created platform should offer the possibility to upload whatever documents researchers may find interesting to share and thus enable scholars from other world regions to access new data. The platform, whether a website or application, should be simple to ensure quick access and use in contexts where smartphones, computers and internet connections may work slowly. A collaborative dictionary to translate Ajami to local languages using Latin script may be envisaged.</p>
